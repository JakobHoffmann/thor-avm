# Corpus Data

## Distribution Profiles

We conducted performance, main memory, and binary size measurements of 19 configurable software systems. Based on this data, we learned the influence of features and (detected) interactions on the respective quality attributes (for more details, see Performance-Influence Model for Highly-Configurable Systems at FSE'15, Predicting Performance via Automated Feature-Interaction Detection at ICSE'12, and SPL Conqueror: Toward Optimization of Non-functional Properties in Software Product Lines at Software Quality Journal 2012). In this repository, we present the extracted values as distribution profiles to be used for other variability models. We omit the mapping to the concrete features, interactions, and variants, since they are not relevant when applying the distribution profiles to other variability models.

## EvaluaionOfGoF

In [EvaluaionOfGoF](/EvaluaionOfGoF), we show additional experimental data for comparing the three Goodness-of-Fit tests.
