This is the supplementary Web site on the manuscript entitled _Attributed Variability Models: Outside the Comfort Zone_.

* [corpusData](corpusData/) contains the data set of performance, main memory, and binary size measurements on 19 real-world systems. These data are used for the replication study (Section 4) and for the Thor evaluation (Section 5).
* [literatureStudy](literatureStudy/) contains background material on the motivating literature study (Section 2.2), e.g., a full bibliographical list of the reviewed papers.
* [replication](replication/) contains the replication package of our robustness study (Section 4), e.g., JMetal sources, deployment scripts, and data sets.
* [Thor](Thor/) contains the sources of the generator tool for attributed variability models (Section 3).
